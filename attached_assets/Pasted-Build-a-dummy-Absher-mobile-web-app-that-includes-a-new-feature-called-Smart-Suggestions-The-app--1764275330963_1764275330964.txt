Build a dummy Absher mobile/web app that includes a new feature called “Smart Suggestions.” The app should simulate how Absher displays personalized suggestion cards at the top of the homepage.
Use dummy APIs, mock user data, and a horizontal card carousel with auto-slide.

1. Tech Stack

Frontend: React (or Next.js preferred if easier)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Data: Local JSON files used as mock APIs

Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material UI (developer’s choice)

2. Features to Build
A. Home Page (Frontend)

Header: “Absher (Dummy App)”

At the top of the home page, add Smart Suggestions Carousel.

The carousel must:

Display multiple suggestion cards side-by-side horizontally

Be scrollable horizontally by the user

Auto-slide every few seconds

Loop continuously

Pause auto-slide on hover

Beneath the suggestions, include a simple dashboard placeholder.

Smart Suggestion Card Format

Each card must include:

Title

Description

Optional expiry date

Action button (e.g., “Take Action”)

Clean, Absher-style green theme

3. Smart Suggestions Engine (Backend)

Create an endpoint:

GET /api/suggestions/:userId

This endpoint must:

Accept userId

Fetch mock user data from the /data folder

Apply suggestion rules

Return an array of suggestions for the carousel

4. Dummy API Data

Create a /data folder containing:

A. users.json

Example entry:

{
  "id": "123",
  "passportExpiry": "2025-01-10",
  "nationalIdExpiry": "2024-12-01",
  "drivingLicenseExpiry": "2024-08-15",
  "violations": [
    { "id": "V1001", "discountExpiry": "2024-07-01T12:00:00Z" }
  ],
  "appointments": [
    { "id": "A2001", "date": "2024-06-30T10:00:00Z" }
  ],
  "delegations": [
    { "id": "D3001", "expires": "2024-07-05" }
  ],
  "hajjEligible": true
}

B. config.json
{
  "expiryThresholdDays": 30,
  "appointmentReminderHours": 24,
  "violationDiscountThresholdHours": 72,
  "delegationExpiryDays": 7
}

5. Suggestion Rules to Implement in Backend
Generate a Smart Suggestion if:
1. Document Expiry

Passport, National ID, or Driver License expires in < 30 days.

2. Traffic Violation Discount

A violation discount expires in < 72 hours.

3. Appointment Reminder

Appointment is within the next 24 hours.

4. Delegation Expiry

Delegation expires within < 7 days.

5. Hajj Eligibility

If hajjEligible = true, show a suggestion 6 months before Hajj period
(Use a dummy logic since data is mocked.)

6. Example API Response
[
  {
    "title": "Passport expiring soon",
    "description": "Your passport will expire in 20 days.",
    "actionUrl": "/passport-renewal"
  },
  {
    "title": "Violation discount ending",
    "description": "A traffic violation discount expires in 48 hours.",
    "actionUrl": "/pay-violation"
  },
  {
    "title": "Appointment Tomorrow",
    "description": "You have an Absher appointment in 24 hours.",
    "actionUrl": "/appointments"
  }
]
